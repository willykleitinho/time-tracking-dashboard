## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- State management
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Font icons

### What I learned

In this project, I created a class for representing each activity and storing each HTMLNode and its related data. I also practiced Flexbox, Grid, responsiveness and better structuring the HTML markup. 

### Continued development

I will learn more about data structures and state management. And soon I'll come back to this project and do it again!
